## ⌨️ Changing Hotkeys

This project uses **Windows Virtual-Key (VK) codes**.

Locate the hotkey section in the source code:

Something like this
```python
V_key = 0x56
```

To change the hotkey, simply replace the Virtual-Key value with another VK code.

**Example**

```python
V_key = 0x42
```

changes the hotkey to **B**.

A full list of Virtual-Key codes can be found in:

- **VirtualKeys.md**
